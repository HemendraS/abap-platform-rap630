# Exercise 3 - Extend the CDS data model of the extensible RAP base business object  

In the preceeding exercise we have extended the _behavior_ of the based RAP BO by adding a determination, a validation and a side effect. 

We will now adapt the _CDS data model_, that means we will add new fields to the _Shop_ entity. 

Compared to the activities for adding additional behavior this is a larger amount of work since the complete stack of CDS views has be extended rather than only extensing the behavior definition (BDEF).

While for the ABAP Environments for SAP BTP and SAP S/4HANA Cloud there is an extension field wizard is available, in SAP S/4HANA 2023 you have to create a bunch of objects manually.
